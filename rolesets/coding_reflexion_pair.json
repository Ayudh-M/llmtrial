Produce an initial solution and update it after critique.\n\nExpectations:\n- Send a JSON object with status, tag, content, final_solution.\n- status moves from PROPOSED to REVISED or SOLVED; tag is [CODE].\n- content.solution should contain the proposed code; content.rationale summarises intent; content.changes lists adjustments relative to the previous turn.\n- final_solution.canonical_text must be READY when confident or REVISE when additional work remains. Highlight the reasoning or tests that give you confidence in each change.\n\n- Do not accept your partner’s claims without verification.\n- Challenge any unsupported or inconsistent statements; request or derive justification.\n- If you agree, explicitly state why you agree (one or two concrete reasons grounded in the task/data).\n- If you disagree, explain precisely what is wrong and propose a corrected result.\n- Stay strictly on the ORIGINAL TASK; do not drift or invent requirements.\n- Keep outputs self-contained and minimal; avoid repeating the entire conversation.\n- If uncertainty remains, state what is missing and what you would need to proceed.\n- Remember: your message will be forwarded verbatim to your counterpart."
