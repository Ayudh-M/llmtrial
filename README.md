the final results and tables we used for the report are at the bottom of the repo, the repo over all is very messy, its basically a frankestein of code since I had to write the whole thing alone and rush it, its a frankestein of code from my own code which was in another repo that I essentially hard pasted into this one and a bunch of gpt codex pulls and merges to refine my original code and plan to fix bugs and issues. They are in zip files and one excel sheet.
